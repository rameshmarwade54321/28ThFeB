//onstructor:
//Date: 13th March 24
//A constructor in Java is a special member of class that is used to initialize global objects/variables.
//The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
//At the time of constructor declaration below points need to follow:
//1. Constructor name should be same as class name.
//2. you should not declare any return type for the constructor (like void).
//3. Any no of constructor can be declared in a java class but constructor name should be same as class name,
//but arguments/parameter should be different--> Constructor overloading.
//Use of Constructor
//1. To copy/load all members of class into object --> when we create object of class
//2. To initialize data member/variable.
//Types of Constructors
//1. Default Constructor
//2. User defined Constructor
//1. Default Constructor
//If Constructor is not declared in java class, then at the time of compilation compiler will provide Constructor for the class
//If programmer has declared the constructor in the class, then compiler will not provide default Constructor.
//The Constructor provided by compiler at the time of compilation is known as Default Constructor
//2. User defined Constructor
//If programmer is declaring constructor in java class then it is considered to be as User defined constructor.
//User defined Constructor are classified into 2 types
//1. Without/zero parameter constructor
//2. With parameter constructor

	
//2. User defined Constructor If programmer is declaring constructor in java class, then it is considered to be as User defined constructor.


//	Example4: Constructor Overloading
//	Date: 18th Mar 24
//	Declaring multiple constructors with same constructor name, but with different parameter in a same class is called constructor overloading

//	Interview Questions:
//		1: What is constructor? types of constructor?
//		2: What is default constructor?
//		3: What is user defined constructor?
//		4: What is a parameterized constructor?
//		A constructor that contains one or more parameters.
//		5: When a constructor is called/invoked in Java?
//		6: Is it possible for a class to have multiple constructors in java?
//		7: Can we Overload Constructor?
//		8: What is Constructor Overloading?
//		9: Can we have more than one constructor with same signature in a class?
//		No, we cannot have more than one constructor with same signature in a class.
//		10. Does a constructor return any value? No
//		11: What happens if you keep a return type for a constructor?
//		Constructor must not have a return type.
//		if we write return type with constructor, It will be treated as a normal method.
//		12: What is the difference between constructor and method?
//		13: what is copy constructor?
//		A constructor which is used to copy the data of one object to another object.
//		14: Do we have destructors in Java?
//		No. Destructors are usually used to deallocate memory and do other cleanup for a class object
//		15. Give an example that proves the definition of constructor.
