//	Access specifiers are use to represent scope of members of class(variables,methods,constructor).
//	In java Access specifiers are classified into 4 types
//	1. private
//	2. default
//	3. protected
//	4. public
//	1. private:
//	If you declare any member of class as private then scope of that member remains only within the class. It can't be access from other classes.
//	2. default:
//	If you declare any member of class as default then scope of that member remains only within the package. It can't be access from other packages.
//	There is no keyword to represent default access specifier.
//	3. protected:
//	If you declare any member of class as protected then scope of that member remains only within the package.
//	that class which is present outside the package can access it by one condition ie. inheritance operation
//	4. public:
//	If you declare any member of class as public then scope of that member remains throught the project.
