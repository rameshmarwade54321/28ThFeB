//	Object
//	Characteristics of objects are:
//	1. State
//	2. Behaviour
//	eg. Marker Pen
//	State->what the objects have-> colour, size, price, weight
//	Behaviour->what the objects do -> write, throw
//	eg. Car
//	State: What the objects have: Speed, Gear, Direction, Fuel level, Engine temperature
//	Behaviour: Change Gear, Go faster/slower, Go in reverse, Stop, Shut-off
//	Student:
//	State: what the objects have, Student have a first name, last name, age, etc
//	Behaviour: what the objects do, Student attend a course "Software testing"
//	In the filed of java each and everything is consider to be as object.
//	Object is copy of class or instance class which is having state & behaviour.
//	where state stands for variable(data member) & behaviour stands for methods(member functions).
//	Inheritance
//	Object-Oriented Programming System(OOPS)
//	Java programming language is very popular in software industry because of OOPS concept.
//	OOps concept provides 5 important pillars/principles for the language they are
//	1. Inheritance
//	2. Polymorphism
//	3. Encapsulation
//	4. Interface
//	5. Abstraction
//	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//	Inheritance:
//	It is one of the Oops principle where one class acquires properties of
//	another class with the help of 'extends' keywords is called Inheritance.
//	The class from where properties are acquiring/inheriting is called super/base/parent class.
//	The class too where properties are inherited/delivered is called sub/child class.
//	Inheritance takes place between 2 or more than 2 classes.
//	Inheritance is classified into 4 types:
//	1. Single level Inheritance
//	2. Multilevel Inheritance
//	3. Multiple Inheritance
//	4. hierarchical Inheritance
//	1. Single level Inheritance:
//	It is a operation where inheritance takes place between only 2 classes.
//	To perform singlelevel inheritance only 2 classes are mandatory.
//	2. Multilevel Inheritance:
//	Multilevel Inheritance takes place between 3 or more than 3 classes.
//	In Multilevel Inheritance 1 sub class acquires properties of another super class &
//	that class acquires properties of its another super class & phenomenon continuous.
//	Object class: Predefined/Readymade class.
//	Note: Object Class is super most class in java
//	3. Multiple Inheritance:
//	1 subclass acquiring properties of 2 super classes at the same time is known as Multiple Inheritance.
//	Java does not support Multiple Inheritance using class because of "Diamond ambiguity" problem.
//	Note: object class is the super most class in java
//	By using interface we can achieve Multiple Inheritance.
//	4. Hierarchical Inheritance:
//	multiple sub classes can acquire properties of 1 super class is known as hierarchical Inheritance.
