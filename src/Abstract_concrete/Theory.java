//	Abstract & Concrete class
//	Abstract class:
//	A class declared with "abstract" keyword is called abstract class.
//	an Abstract class is nothing but an incomplete class where programmer
//	can declare complete as well as incomplete methods in it.
//	programmer can declare incomplete methods as abstract method, by declaring keyword
//	called "abstract" Infront of method.
//	we cannot create object of abstract class, to create object of abstract class we need
//	to make use of concrete class.
//	Concrete class:
//	A class which provides definitions for all the incomplete methods which are
//	present in abstract class with the help of extends keywords is called concrete class.
//	Q1: Can 1 Class extends another Class? yes
//	Q2: Can 1 Abstract Class extends another Abstract Class? yes
